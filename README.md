This is the repository for my personal technical experience site located [http://www.ryankoval.com](http://www.ryankoval.com). It was implemented and styled completely by me using an entirely JavaScript-based stack.

Below is the primary list of technologies I used to build it:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)
- [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
