- title: Oracle Certified Professional – Java SE6 Programmer
  date: '2011-10-01'
  awarder: Oracle
  summary: Oracle's Certified Professional Java SE Programmer exam is the fundamental
    exam required to demonstrate solid understanding of Java and some of its SE APIs
    and is a prerequisite to a number of the other Java certificates. It is designed
    as a fairly detailed test of knowledge of the core features and constructs of
    the Java programming language. It tests a wide range of Java's APIs and core features,
    starting from basics such as looping constructs and variables, to more complex
    topics such as Threads, Collections and Generics. It does not cover specific technology
    domains such as GUI creation, Web or network programming, though it does cover
    part of the APIs included in the standard library. The exam tests how well a programmer
    has understood the language constructs and mechanisms. However it's not a goal
    of the exam to test the programmer's ability to produce purposeful or efficient
    programs. It does not test the programmer's ability to write efficient algorithms,
    for example, though it does test knowledge of which collections should be selected
    in order to implement efficient algorithms without re-inventing the wheel.
